14. Payment Reserve and Offset Amendment

This Payment Reserve and Offset Amendment ("Amendment") is incorporated into and forms part of the Palletium Terms of Service. Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings given in the Terms of Service.

14.1 Purpose
This Amendment describes how Palletium manages the Reserve Fund referenced in Section 4.2, and how chargebacks, refunds, and payment reversals may affect artist payouts.

14.2 Reserve Fund Operation
Palletium maintains a payment integrity reserve (the "Reserve Fund") equal to 5% of subscription revenue. The Reserve Fund exists to:
• Absorb chargebacks initiated by payment card issuers
• Cover refunds issued to subscribers
• Protect the artist payout pool and listener rewards pool from payment reversals
• Ensure platform solvency during dispute resolution periods

Reserve funds are held in a segregated ledger account and are not commingled with artist payout balances.

14.3 Chargebacks and Disputes
When a chargeback or payment dispute is filed against a subscription payment:
(a) The associated funding event is flagged as "DISPUTED" in the platform ledger.
(b) Listener rewards (if any) distributed from the disputed payment are voided.
(c) If the dispute is resolved in favor of Palletium ("CHARGEBACK_WON"), the funding event is restored and no further action is taken against artist earnings.
(d) If the dispute is resolved against Palletium ("REVERSED"), the funding event amount is deducted from the Reserve Fund. Plays attributed to the reversed funding event may be reclassified for accounting purposes.

14.4 Refunds
When Palletium issues a refund for a subscription payment:
(a) The associated funding event is marked as "REFUNDED" in the platform ledger.
(b) Listener rewards distributed from the refunded payment are voided.
(c) The refunded amount is deducted from the Reserve Fund.

14.5 Negative Balance and Offset Rights
If chargebacks, refunds, or reversals attributable to plays on an artist's tracks exceed the available Reserve Fund allocation for the relevant period, Palletium may record a Negative Balance against the artist's account.

Palletium reserves the right to offset future payout amounts by the Negative Balance, subject to the following conditions:
• Offsets will not be applied until Palletium provides the artist with written notice (via email or in-platform notification) of the Negative Balance amount and the underlying events.
• Artists may dispute a Negative Balance by contacting support@palletium.com within 30 days of notice.
• Offsets will not reduce any single payout by more than 50% of the gross payout amount.

As of the effective date of this Amendment, Negative Balance offsets are not yet enforced. Palletium will provide at least 30 days' notice before activating offset enforcement.

14.6 Audit Trail
All reserve fund movements, chargebacks, refunds, reversals, and offsets are recorded in an immutable financial audit log. Artists may request a summary of events affecting their account by contacting support@palletium.com.

14.7 Limitation
Nothing in this Amendment creates an obligation for Palletium to maintain a Reserve Fund at any specific level, or guarantees that the Reserve Fund will be sufficient to cover all chargebacks, refunds, or reversals. Palletium may adjust the reserve percentage with 30 days' notice to artists.

14.8 Effective Date
This Amendment is effective as of February 20, 2026.`;
